|:bookmark_tabs:|  Welcome to Jumbo!
====================================================

Jumbo is a wrapper of the amazing ``psycopg2`` - the most popular PostgreSQL
database adapter for the Python programming language.

Jumbo has been designed specifically for adoption in environments where
thorough widespread knowledge of SQL protocols might be lacking and a
streamlined approach to database interactions might be needed. Jumbo offers an
intuitive and quickly deployable interface to successfully implement a
database-centred data analysis pipeline at all levels of your team or
organisation.

Jumbo is intuitive yet customisable - first-time users can easily interact
with the database without worrying about handling transactions under the hood.
At the same time, experienced PostgreSQL architects can still unleash the full
power of ``psycopg2`` and exploit its more advanced functionalities.

If it's your first time using jumbo head over to *First Steps* to setup your
installation environment. If you are already familiar with jumbo simply
follow the *Quick Start* guide below.

|:rocket:| Quick Start
=================================

1. |:book:| Install jumbo like any other Python package, using pip to
download it from PyPI:

   .. code-block:: pycon

      $ pip install jumbo


2. |:elephant:| Make sure you have created a jumbo.env file in the root
directory of your project with the following structure:

   .. code-block::

      DATABASE_HOST = <my_database_host_address>
      DATABASE_USERNAME = <my_database_user_name>
      DATABASE_PASSWORD = <my_database_user_password>
      DATABASE_PORT = <my_database_port>
      DATABASE_NAME = <my_database_name>

3. |:snake:| Now test your installation running the following minimal
script:

   .. code-block:: python

      import jumbo

      # Initialize database connection
      database = jumbo.database.Database()

      # Open a connection pool.
      with database.open() as pool:

         # Get an individual connection from the pool.
         with pool.connect():

            pass

4. |:partying_face:| If everything went well you are now all set-up to use
the JumboSQL library! Enjoy!
