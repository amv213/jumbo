# üê∂ Filesystem Watchdogs


In this tutorial you will learn how to use jumbo's watchdog functionalities. By the end you will have created a simple watchdog looking for any new data being written in a directory and uploading it automatically to a database table.

First things first:

- make sure you have a PostgreSQL server available, and a user account to connect to it.
- make sure you have a properly configured jumbo.env file in the root directory of this notebook

   .. code-block::

         DATABASE_HOST = <my_database_host_address>
         DATABASE_USERNAME = <my_database_user_name>
         DATABASE_PASSWORD = <my_database_user_password>
         DATABASE_PORT = <my_database_port>
         DATABASE_NAME = <my_database_name>

- make sure your user account has appropriate permissions on the database tables you will access

If you are deploying jumbo in practical applications, you might be interested in deploying a watchdog to automatically stream new data to a table in your database. Ideally you would interface directly with the data generator and INSERT each new data entry to the table, but this is not always possible. Data acquisition from the data generator might be blocked by proprietary software, or for legacy reasons you cannot interfere directly with the data collection protocol already in place. In this cases the only thing left to do might be to monitor the output files where data is being saved to and upload any change to the database.

## Watchdogs


Let's setup everything to simulate our working environment. We need two things:

- A bot script writing data to files, to simulate a real data generator
- Our watchdog deployed to monitor those files

Let's start by setting-up a very simple monkey-writer. The following code does nothing special, it will simply write the current timestamp to a file called *fake_data.txt* in the *data* directory. Each write will happen after a random time interval. Run the following code to get a feeling of how it works and then STOP IT before moving to the next section.

   .. code-block:: python

        # Monkey Writer

        import time
        import loguru
        import numpy

        try:

            while True:

                # Need to open/close file on every write so that watchdog can see each change
                with open('data/fake_data.txt', "a") as f:

                    # Write current timestamp
                    number = time.time()
                    f.write(str(number) + '\n')
                    loguru.logger.debug(f"Wrote number {number} to file")

                # Wait a variable amount of time before writing next
                time.sleep(numpy.random.randint(10))

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            loguru.logger.error("Monkey writer has been stopped via Keyboard Interrupt.")


Now that we have a data source let's deploy a watchdog on the *data* folder.

Jumbo let's you create watchdogs very easily. Here is  jumbo's implementation of a watchdog:

   .. code-block:: python

        import jumbo

        # Initialize database
        database = jumbo.database.Database()

        # Create a connection pool
        with database.open() as pool:

            # Get individual connections from the pool
            with pool.connect(key=1):

                # Initialize the table to hold watched data
                SQL_CREATE_TABLE = 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data_container (ID FLOAT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL);'
                pool.send(SQL_CREATE_TABLE, key=1)

                # Template SQL command to inject table with entries from file
                SQL_INSERT_IN_TABLE = "INSERT INTO data_container (ID) VALUES (%s)"  # %s will be replaced with .txt line fields

                # Create watchdog
                fido = jumbo.handlers.FileWatcher(pool, SQL_INSERT_IN_TABLE, 'data/', timeout=0.5, key=1)

                # Deploy watchdog
                fido.bark()

Let's have a look at what is going on in the code:

As we have seen before we start by creating a database object, opening a connection pool, and setting  up a connection to the PostgreSQL database. We then create a table on the database to hold the data we will collecting from the files, and prepare an INSERT statement to dynamically insert the values collected from the files into the table.

We then create a jumbo handlers.FileWatcher watchdog

    .. code-block:: python

        jumbo.handlers.FileWatcher(pool, SQL_INSERT_IN_TABLE, 'data/', timeout=0.5, key=1)


This watchdog looks for changes in .txt files in the *data* folder by polling for changes every 0.5s. It then executes the query template of our choice with every new entry added to the files passed dynamically. That is everytime a change is detected the watchdog will implicitely perform a

    .. code-block:: postgresql

        INSERT INTO data_container (ID) new_value;

Finally we deploy the watchdog via the .bark() method. This activates the watchdog and schedules it's handler to fire on each 'file modified event' detected.

Don't hesitate to have a look at the documentation to look at all the customisable parameters. Or have a look at the source code to implement your own tailored watchdogs! You can implement your own watchdogs and event handlers!

Now run both code scripts above at the same time and see if the behaviour in the logs makes sense!
